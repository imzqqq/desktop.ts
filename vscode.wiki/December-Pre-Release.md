A pre-release of the [December update](../issues/917) is now available on the so called `insiders` channel (see below). 

> 

We love getting feedback on the pre-release and you can help us in many ways:
- test new features as described in the [[December Test Plan]].
- verify the bugs you have filed and that are targeting the December milestone [bug fixes](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3Abug+milestone%3A%22Dec+2015%22).

## Reporting Issues
When reporting issues please mention in the comment that you found the issue in the `insiders` release and follow our reporting issues guidelines [[Submitting-Bugs-and-Suggestions]].

Since we are also testing the same release, please do a duplicate search and comment on the existing issue before creating a new one.

## Getting the update
**Notice** the release notes are not up to date yet, to find out about new features check the [December plan](../issues/917) or the [[December Test Plan]].

The updated version of Code is 0.10.4, once updated you will see this in the `Help | About` or `Code | About Visual Studio Code` dialog.

### Getting the update for Windows and Mac OS X
Follow [these steps](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/supporting/FAQ#_how-can-i-test-prerelease-versions-of-vs-code). 

### Getting the update on Linux
On Linux you must manually update (no support for auto-update):

1. Download Code from this location [Linux 64](https://az764295.vo.msecnd.net/public/0.10.4/VSCode-linux64.zip), [Linux 32](https://az764295.vo.msecnd.net/public/0.10.4/VSCode-linux32.zip).
2. Open the Zip and run Code.
3. Code will require a manual update each time we release.

## Reverting back to the most recent stable version
To revert to the standard build, reverse the updates you made to your storage.json i.e. back to stable from insiders.   At that point you will receive the 0.10.3 update again. 

If all else fails, uninstall the Update and re-install from http://code.visualstudio.com.
