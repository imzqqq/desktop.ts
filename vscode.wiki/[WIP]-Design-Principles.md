# Intro
In order for a product to evolve there needs to be a set of core principles that will guide it in the right direction. Here are a set of over-arching design principles that we apply to our problem solving. Additionally, our [design checklist](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/wiki/%5BWIP%5D-Design-Checklist) will be based off these principles.

# Design principles
## Think universal
We focus on what unifies people—human motivations, relationships, and abilities. This drives us to consider the broader social impact of our work. The result is an experience that has a diversity of ways for all people to participate.

- Accessible
- Support for keyboard-only
- All users (new and existing)

## Make it personal
We challenge ourselves to create an emotional connection. Human-to-human interactions can inspire better human-to-technology interaction. A person’s unique circumstances can improve a design for everyone. The result is an experience that feels like it was created for one person.

- Customizable
- Extensible

## Keep it simple
We start with simplicity as the ultimate unifier. When we reduce clutter people know what to do next. They’re inspired to move forward into spaces that are clean, light, and open. The result is an experience that’s honest and timeless.

- Clear
- Intuitive
- Iterative
- Minimal

## Create delight
Delightful experiences evoke wonder and discovery. Sometimes it’s magical. Sometimes it’s a detail that’s just right. We design these moments to feel like a welcomed change in tempo. The result is an experience that has momentum and flow.

- Harmonious
- Contextual
- Empowering
- Discovery
- Attention to detail
